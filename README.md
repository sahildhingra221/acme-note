## Optimizations and Performance

- Selective Bootstrap Integration: Instead of relying entirely on Bootstrap, I selectively incorporated specific classes and CSS rules to streamline code and enhance loading speed.
- Reusable Components: Implemented common buttons and classes throughout the codebase to promote reusability and maintain consistency, ultimately optimizing the development process.
- Image Optimization: Utilized PNG format for images and compressed them to desired sizes, ensuring optimal quality without compromising on loading speed.
- Local Image Hosting: By hosting images locally, we eliminated the delay associated with loading images from a CDN, resulting in faster page rendering and enhanced user experience.
- Code Splitting: Employed code splitting techniques to divide the codebase into smaller, more manageable chunks, facilitating faster initial page loads and better resource utilization.
- Styled Components: Utilized Styled Components for efficient styling, enabling component-based CSS management and enhancing code maintainability.
- Responsive Design: Ensured the landing page is fully responsive across various devices and screen sizes, guaranteeing an optimal viewing experience for all users.
- Used PageSpeed Insights for performance review and we can also check the same on lighthouse.
- Code Quality Assurance: Implemented ESLint to enforce coding standards and catch potential errors, ensuring clean and consistent code throughout the project.
